# Breakpoint Chrome Extension

Description: (Project under development) Chrome extension to help designers and developers to generate media-queries to their Responsive Design projects.

## History

Developing a new project I had to resize and write the media-queries code every time
So I decided develop an Google Chrome extension to help Designers and Developers generate the code after resize the window.

Pretty simple and useful.

## Usage

1. Add the extension to your Google Chrome browser.
2. Start resize your window and see where your content are breaking.
3. Click into the Breakpoint extension.
4. Paste into your style file and do your thing.

## Features
1. add/export breakpoints.
2. history of your lasts generated breakpoints.
